						Brookhouse, Slade Hooton, Carr and Newhall. Laughten-en-le-Morthen is a small dormitory village and civil parish 
						in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, lying to the south of Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

				<h1>About Laughten-en-le-Morthen</h1>
				
				<p style="margin: 25px;">
					Laughten-en-le-Morthen Parish Council was formed in 1994 after a decision was taken by the 
					Boundaries Commision as a result of a public consultation process started in 1986, when
					parishioners requested the formation of their own parish. Meetings are held on the 2nd Wednesday 
					of every month (except august) and take place from 7pm in the Village Hall located in 
					Firbeck Avenue. Documents relating to previous meetings can be found in the 'Meetings & 
					Minutes' section of the website.
				</p>
				
				<p style="margin: 25px;">
					The Parish Council is the first tier of government, though Laughten-en-le-Morthen Parish 
					Council is not aligned to any political party. All our meetings are open to parishioners who 
					are welcome to attend; an agenda for the forthcoming meeting can be requested by contacting 
					the Clerk to the Council.
				</p>
				
				<p style="margin: 25px;">
					Our elected members work on a voluntary basis and do not claim any expenses relating to their 
					role as councilors. In brief, the Parish Council discusses, governs and sets policies 
					relating to the following areas, many of which are detailed further throughout the website:
