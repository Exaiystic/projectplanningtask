					<h1>Laughten-en-le-Morthen</h1>
					<h2>History</h2>
					
					<p>
					    What's in a name?
					</p><p>
					    The origin of the village's name has several theories. In the Doomsday Book the village name is 
						'Lastone', yet the Saxon name was 'Law town'. The word 'Morthen' derives from the old norse 
						term 'Morthing' meaning 'a moorland district with a common assembly'. An alternative theory comes 
						from the old French 'en le Morthen' word for 'place of death'. This theory is based on 
						information that the area around Laughten-en-le-Morthen was part of the site of the battle of 
						Brunanburh around 937AD. This is commemorated in Celtic legend as the last chance to regain 
						the mainland from the Saxons. In truth it was more a case of the various Celtic and Viking chieftans 
						and lords (this was part of Yorvik) versus resurgent Saxon power. Approximately 50,000 warriors 
						are reputed to have died in the most decisive battle for the control of the future history of the 
						British Isles. If so, it is a well-deserved name as the death toll was comparable to Britain's 
						entire World War II death toll as a proportion of the population.
					</p><p>
					    In contrast, it is also recorded that the village was commonly known by the name of 'Lighten in the 
						Morning' - looking eastward to the village, the lofty spire was clearly defined in the early light 
						of the morning.

					    From 1066 to 1379
					</p><p>
					    Before 1066, Laughton belonged to Earl Edwin who had a hall there. Held by Roger de Busli in 1086, 
						Laughton was the head of a large soke within the honour of Tickhill and was a thriving village. 
						Roger de Busli had 5 plough teams of his own and the population of 33 villeins and 6 small holders 
						had ten plough teams between them. Eventually the de Busli honour of Tickhill passed to King 
						Henry I who gave the church of Laughton to the Canon of York.
					</p><p>
					    Until the 13th century, the Manor of Laughton remained in the hands of the crown. The manor was 
						then given to Geoffrey de Lusignan by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. Drogo de Merlawe was 
						Lord of the Manor in the reign of Edward II. In 1332 the lordship had passed to the Frenchman 
						Ralph, Earl of Eu. In 1332 Vicar of Laughton, James de Brampton, was fined for beating 
						Hugh de Lindesay, one of the Earl of Eu servants. The estates of the Earl were seized at 
						the outbreak of the 100 Year War and returned into the hands of the crown.
					</p><p>
					    In the poll tax of 1379, Laughton lists 232 people assessed for the tax, representing a 
						population of 450. The subsidy or poll tax was collected for King Richard II and 
						comprised a tax of at least 4d. For every inhabitant over the age of 16, both male and 
						female - only beggars were exempted. Most tradesmen or small businessmen were 
						required to pay 6d; more prosperous merchants, gentry, yeomen and lords of manors paid 
						more. The Laughton entry includes tax payers living in nearby townships. The most 
						prosperous inhabitant was John de Kirke who was described as a 'Merchant Sufficant' 
						('Supply Merchant'). He was assessed at the sum of 13s 4d, showing that he was a 
						very wealthy man indeed. A draper and a cattle merchant were assessed as 1s while 13 
						tradesmen were paid 6d.
