					<h1>Laughten-en-le-Morthen</h1>
					<h2>History</h2>
					
					<h3>
					    What's in a name?
					</h3><p>
					    The origin of the village's name has several theories. In the Doomsday Book the village name is 
						'Lastone', yet the Saxon name was 'Law town'. The word 'Morthen' derives from the old norse 
						term 'Morthing' meaning 'a moorland district with a common assembly'. An alternative theory comes 
						from the old French 'en le Morthen' word for 'place of death'. This theory is based on 
						information that the area around Laughten-en-le-Morthen was part of the site of the battle of 
						Brunanburh around 937AD. This is commemorated in Celtic legend as the last chance to regain 
						the mainland from the Saxons. In truth it was more a case of the various Celtic and Viking chieftans 
						and lords (this was part of Yorvik) versus resurgent Saxon power. Approximately 50,000 warriors 
						are reputed to have died in the most decisive battle for the control of the future history of the 
						British Isles. If so, it is a well-deserved name as the death toll was comparable to Britain's 
						entire World War II death toll as a proportion of the population.
					</p><p>
					    In contrast, it is also recorded that the village was commonly known by the name of 'Lighten in the 
						Morning' - looking eastward to the village, the lofty spire was clearly defined in the early light 
						of the morning.

					<h3>
					    From 1066 to 1379
					</h3><p>
					    Before 1066, Laughton belonged to Earl Edwin who had a hall there. Held by Roger de Busli in 1086, 
						Laughton was the head of a large soke within the honour of Tickhill and was a thriving village. 
						Roger de Busli had 5 plough teams of his own and the population of 33 villeins and 6 small holders 
						had ten plough teams between them. Eventually the de Busli honour of Tickhill passed to King 
						Henry I who gave the church of Laughton to the Canon of York.
					</p><p>
					    Until the 13th century, the Manor of Laughton remained in the hands of the crown. The manor was 
						then given to Geoffrey de Lusignan by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. Drogo de Merlawe was 
						Lord of the Manor in the reign of Edward II. In 1332 the lordship had passed to the Frenchman 
						Ralph, Earl of Eu. In 1332 Vicar of Laughton, James de Brampton, was fined for beating 
						Hugh de Lindesay, one of the Earl of Eu servants. The estates of the Earl were seized at 
						the outbreak of the 100 Year War and returned into the hands of the crown.
					</p><p>
					    In the poll tax of 1379, Laughton lists 232 people assessed for the tax, representing a 
						population of 450. The subsidy or poll tax was collected for King Richard II and 
						comprised a tax of at least 4d. For every inhabitant over the age of 16, both male and 
						female - only beggars were exempted. Most tradesmen or small businessmen were 
						required to pay 6d; more prosperous merchants, gentry, yeomen and lords of manors paid 
						more. The Laughton entry includes tax payers living in nearby townships. The most 
						prosperous inhabitant was John de Kirke who was described as a 'Merchant Sufficant' 
						('Supply Merchant'). He was assessed at the sum of 13s 4d, showing that he was a 
						very wealthy man indeed. A draper and a cattle merchant were assessed as 1s while 13 
						tradesmen were paid 6d.

					<h3>
					    The St Ledgers and Hatfields
					</h3><p>
					    In 1577 the Manor of Laughton was in the hands of the Queen. By the 17th century it had 
						passed to the Lords of Kiveton, the Eyre family. In 1644 Sir Gervas Eyre was killed 
						fighting for the king at the siege of Newark. In 1767 Anothony Eyre, his great grandson, 
						sold the manor to Anthony St Leger of Parkhill, Firbeck. In Laughton the Hatfields were 
						the main rivals of the Eire's. The Hatfeilds came to Laughton when Ralph Hatfeild 
						married a daughter of Robert Mirfield of Thurcroft.
					</p><p>
					    In 1652, Martha, the 12 year old daughter of Anthony and Faith Hatfield, gained national 
						notoriety when she was seized by an illness which caused her to have fits which 
						prevented her from moving or seeing. During these fits she was able to speak and astonished 
						people with the piety and wisdom of her utterances. Visitors and pilgrims came from far 
						and wide to see her. Between 1653 and 1664 a book about her: "The Wise Virgin", ran to 5 
						editions. After 8 months the fits passed and normality returned to Laughton. The 
						Hatfeild dynasty of Laughton laste until 1791 when the unmarried John Hatfeild died.
					</p><p>
					    In the Hearth Tax return of 1672, the parish of Laughton lists 105 houses, of which 94 paid 
						the tax, of these over hald had only 1 hearth. Schoolmaster John Broomhead occupied a 
						house with 5 hearths while Nicholas Pearson's house boasted 14, William Hatfeild had 13 
						and William Beckwith at Thurcroft Hall had 11. The Hearth Tax was a shilling a hearth 
						collected twice a year at Michelmas and Lady Day. Rev Robert Browne reported in the 1743 
						Visitation Returns that there were 107 families in the parish.
					</p><p>
					    Moves were made to enclose the remaining open fields and commons shortly after Anthony St 
						Leger purchased the manor of Laughton. In 1769 The Act of Parliament for the enclosure 
						was passed and the process was completed in 1771. Over the years a considerable portion of 
						the parish had already been enclosed. Almost 580 acres of the 1172 acres of newly 
						enclosed land was allotted to Anthony St Leger as Lord of the Manor, 189 acres to Doctor Hugh 
						Thomas prebend of Laughton and 173 acres to John Hatfield.
					</p><p>
					    The enclosure award replaced the payment of tithes in kind on the newly enclosed lands, 
						replacing them with a rent charge. Tithes remained payable on the old enclosures 
						until they were converted by the Tithe Award of 1840.

					    All Saints' Church
					</h3><p>
					    Laughton All Saints’ Church was Mother church to a large area, an indication of Laughton's 
						importance in Anglo-Saxon times. The original Saxon church was of a simple rectangular 
						construction. It is suggested that this church was destroyed following Earl Edwin's unsuccessful 
						rebellion against William I in 1069-70, but there is no evidence to support this. Rebuilding 
						in Norman style began in 1190 when a North aisle was added. The church was rebuilt again in 1377 
						and it was at this time that the 185 foot tower and spire were added. The architect for this 
						work was probably William of Wykeham as he had been appointed Prebend of Laughton-en-le-Morthen 
						in York Minster in 1363. Salisbury Cathedral is another of Williams' works. The North arcade 
						of the nave retains its Norman columns, while in the lower courses of the chancel walls Saxon 
						stonework can be seen.
					</p><p>
					    A pre-Reformation stone alter table which was found buried in the South aisle during the 19th 
						century is contained in the Lady Chapel. In 1857 considerable alterations and repairs
						to the church were carried out and paid for by AFB St Leger, the Lord of the Manor. In 1693 the 
						vicarage was described as "a dwelling containing about three bays of building". It had 
						been enlarged to 5 bays by 1716. As late as 1817 most of the downstairs rooms still had earth 
						floors. The present vicarage dates from 1840.

					    All Saints' School
					</h3><p>
					    In 1610, Edmund Laughton of Throapham and Anthony Eyre gave adjoining plots of land for the 
						construction of the Laughton Endowed School "for the learning and instruction in 
						learning of the children of the inhabitants of the township and parish of Laughton". 
						Endowments were also made by John West, William Beckwith and William Laughton. 
						A house for the school master was erected 1670. Local trustees had the power to levy rates on 
						the inhabitants for the support of the school. In 1820 the school was found to be in 
						"ruin and decay" by Charity Commissioners and the trust deeds had been lost. By the mid-19th 
						century the school was accepted as a Church of England Aided School. In 1850 the building 
						was extended. The 1865 Visitation Returns state that there was a boys' and girl's school, the 
						boys' school being supported by the endowments and the other by public subscription.

					    Slade Hooton
					</h3><p>
					    To the North of Laughton-en-le-Morthen lies the hamlet of Slade Hooton. The word ‘Hooton’ comes 
						from the Saxon term ‘hoo’ meaning high town or hill town and ‘Slade’ comes from the 
						Norse 'slaed' meaning a valley. Slade Hooton appeared in the Domesday Book as a manor called 
						Hotone within the soke of Laughton, with three carucates of land. Despite its small size, 
						the hamlet was divided into two manors in the Middle Ages. One manor came into the hands of the 
						lords of Loversall (Ripers family) who gave their manor to Roche Abbey. At the Dissolution 
						in 1538, this manor was granted to Richard Turke who sold it to Robert Saunderson, ancestor of 
						the Earls of Scarbrough.
					</p><p>
					    In the 16th century William Fitzwilliam, Earl of Southampton (d. 1542) owned the other manor. 
						He gave Slade Hooton and other lands in the area to John Fitzwilliam of Kingsley 
						(Hants). This grant was later challenged by the Earl's niece, wife of Sir James Foljambe 
						and the case was settled in 1563 in favour of Godfrey Foljambe of Croxden.
					</p><p>
					    In 1379, the Poll Tax Records indicate that John Mirfin was a blacksmith in the area. 
						Subsequently the Mirfin family farmed much of the surrounding land and became 
						the main freeholders within the hamlet. Slade Hooton Hall was built in 1698 for John Mirfin. 
						It was constructed of local limestone under a Cornish slate roof and is one of the 
						earliest examples of a classically designed house in the region. The stable block and barn 
						were added in 1702 and 1705. The present hall forms part of a complex of listed 
						buildings including the hall, walls, gates, stable block and barn.

					    History and Features of Brookhouse
					</h3><p>
					    The hamlet of Brookhouse lies 10km south east of Rotherham Town Centre, to the north of 
						Laughton-en-le-Morthen. The area to the west of Bib Lane forms part of the Civil 
						Parish of Thurcroft; the rest of the hamlet to the east of Bib Lane forms part of 
						Laughton-en-le-Morthen Parish.
					</p><p>
					    Physically, the hamlet is a linear settlement built around the main street which parallels 
						Brookhouse dyke, the most significant feature of the hamlet. The dyke and hamlet 
						nestle in a valley with sweeping views towards open countryside to the north and 
						Laughton-en-le-Morthen to the south.
					</p><p>
					    Unlike surrounding settlements like Dinnington and Laughton-en-le-Morthen, Brookhouse 
						receives no mention in the Domesday book. Nearby Thurcoft Hall and the 
						surrounding Thurcroft Estate are referred to as early as the 15th Century when they were 
						in the possession of the Mirfin/Mirfield family. In 1664, Robert Mirfield died 
						childless and through marriage the estate passed into the Beckwith family who held property 
						at Aldborough and Ripon.
					</p><p>
					    The hamlet itself, built along the dyke has a historic core centred on Brookhouse Farm and Pear 
						Tree Farm that date back to the 17th Century. From the historic map of 1850, it can be 
						seen that this western section of the hamlet was very much as we see it today. Historically, 
						the next major event in the development of the hamlet was the building of the South 
						Yorkshire Joint Railway and the viaduct that so dominates the eastern approach to the hamlet. 
						The line opened in 1909, its prime purpose to serve eight collieries in the South 
						Yorkshire coalfield linked to a junction with the Midland and Great Central Joint Railway 
						just south of Dinnington. The line encounters hilly country throughout its route and 
						is characterised by several large viaducts, the largest of which is the one at Brookhouse.
					</p><p>
					    The next significant phase of the hamlet’s development, the ribbon development between the 
						Cartwheel and the Travellers Rest took place piecemeal in the 1960s and 1970s. 
						There are three buildings in the hamlet that are listed, all adjacent to each other on 
						the main Street:
