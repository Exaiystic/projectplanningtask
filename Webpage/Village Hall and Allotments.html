					    Laughton Village Hall is owned by the Parish Council and operated by a 
						volunteer Village Hall Management Committee. A mutually agreed constitution 
						identifies the responsibilities the council and the Management Committee 
						have in respect of the Village Hall.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="wrapper">
				
				    <p>
					    The Management Committee oversee the day to day running of the Village Hall and 
						carry out fundraising events to cover the costs involved in the upkeep of 
						the hall. Their efforts help to keep the hire rates at an affordable level for 
						hall users. The Parish Council subsidise the Village Hall by covering the 
						following areas of expenditure:
					</p>
					
					<div id="rightAlignContainer"> <!-- Container with text set to be aligned to right side of container -->
					    <p>
						    Grounds-keeping charges for grass cutting, upkeep of the car park & 
							maintenance of the football pitch.
						</p><p><!-- Using separate <p> tags adds more space between paragraphs. Great for lists -->
						    Servicing and maintenance of the CCTV system which covers the hall, car 
							park & recreation ground.
						</p><p>
						    Electrical costs incurred by the CCTV & exterior lights.
						</p><p>
						    Purchase of capital items such as cleaning equipment.
						</p><p>
						    Inspections & repairs to the hall’s interior electrics.
						</p><p>
						    Buildings insurance & employer’s liability insurance.
						</p>

				    <p>
					    The hall is equipped with a full size dance floor which is ideal for private 
						functions such as weddings and parties. In terms of capacity, 120 people can 
						enjoy a sit down meal or a maximum of 150 for a buffet and disco. Although we 
						have an entertainment’s licence, we are not licensed for the sale of alcohol, 
						so anyone requiring a bar would be responsible for obtaining the necessary 
						licence.
                    </p><p>
						The Village Hall’s outdoor facilities include a floodlit car park with 70 
						spaces which is covered by 24 hour CCTV surveillance. There is a well maintained 
						football pitch with changing room which provides local teams with a home 
						ground. We also have a fantastic playground which caters for children of all 
						ages and abilities.

				    <h3>St John's Road Allotments, Laughton-en-le-Morthen</h3>
					
					<p>
					    The allotment site at St John’s Road, Laughton-en-le-Morthen has been leased 
						from the St Leger Estate by the Parish Council for over 100 years. 
						The area provides a total of 97 plots which are available to rent by anyone 
						living within 5 miles of the parish. The allotments are provided for 
						the cultivation of produce for the benefit of the allotment holder and his/her 
						immediate family. Allotments are not provided for the purpose of any 
						trade or business for financial gain.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					    The Parish Council oversee the letting of plots and administrative duties 
						involved in leasing the site, though the day-to-day running 
						is carried out by a voluntary committee, the St John’s Road Allotment Society, 
						made up of existing tenants. All tenants are required to pay a 
						subscription to the National Society of Allotment & Leisure Gardeners, 
						in addition to their annual rent charge. The rent for an 
						individual plot is set annually and includes access to the water supply. 
						Please contact the Clerk for information on the current annual charge.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					    The St John’s Road Allotment Society operate a well-stocked shop on the site 
						which sells vegetable seeds, bird feed, compost, fertiliser and 
						other gardening-related products. It is currently open every Saturday between 
						11am – 12noon. Non-tenants who wish to purchase items from the site can 
						do so by joining the society for a nominal annual fee. Details can be obtained 
						from the allotment shop.
					</p>
					
					<div id="rightAlignContainer">
						<p>
							Since the St John’s Road Allotment Society was formed in 2010, a number of 
							joint projects with the Parish Council have been carried out to 
							improve the site. This includes:
						</p>
					
					    <p>
						    The removal of asbestos from the site.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Upgrades to the on-site security including new locks and additional barriers.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Assistance in the removal of rubbish from many of the plots.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    The creation of a communal garden area (on-going).
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Regular hedge-trimming to improve the entrance road.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Purchase of road-scalpings to fill potholes on the allotment track.
						</p>
