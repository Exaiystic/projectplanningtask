					<h2>Village Hall and Allotments</h2>			
	  
	                <p>
					    Laughton Village Hall is owned by the Parish Council and operated by a 
						volunteer Village Hall Management Committee. A mutually agreed constitution 
						identifies the responsibilities the council and the Management Committee 
						have in respect of the Village Hall.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="wrapper">
				
				    <p>
					    The Management Committee oversee the day to day running of the Village Hall and 
						carry out fundraising events to cover the costs involved in the upkeep of 
						the hall. Their efforts help to keep the hire rates at an affordable level for 
						hall users. The Parish Council subsidise the Village Hall by covering the 
						following areas of expenditure:
					</p>
					
					<div id="rightAlignContainer">
					    <p>
						    Grounds-keeping charges for grass cutting, upkeep of the car park & 
							maintenance of the football pitch.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Servicing and maintenance of the CCTV system which covers the hall, car 
							park & recreation ground.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Electrical costs incurred by the CCTV & exterior lights.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Purchase of capital items such as cleaning equipment.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Inspections & repairs to the hall’s interior electrics.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						    Buildings insurance & employer’s liability insurance.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				    <p>
					    The hall is equipped with a full size dance floor which is ideal for private 
						functions such as weddings and parties. In terms of capacity, 120 people can 
						enjoy a sit down meal or a maximum of 150 for a buffet and disco. Although we 
						have an entertainment’s licence, we are not licensed for the sale of alcohol, 
						so anyone requiring a bar would be responsible for obtaining the necessary 
						licence.
                    </p><p>
						The Village Hall’s outdoor facilities include a floodlit car park with 70 
						spaces which is covered by 24 hour CCTV surveillance. There is a well maintained 
						football pitch with changing room which provides local teams with a home 
						ground. We also have a fantastic playground which caters for children of all 
						ages and abilities.
                    </p>
